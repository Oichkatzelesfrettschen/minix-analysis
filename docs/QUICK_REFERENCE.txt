QEMU TIMING ARCHITECTURE: QUICK REFERENCE CARD
================================================================================

THE FORMULA (Non-negotiable):
  QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL = instruction_count << 3
  1 instruction = 8 nanoseconds
  125 million instructions = 1 second

THE PARADOX:
  Q: Why can't we speed up simulation?
  A: Because cycle count defines virtual time. Impossible to execute N 
     instructions and claim they only took M < N seconds.

THE THREE CONSTRAINTS (Coupled, cannot decouple):
  1. Instruction counting MUST be exact
  2. Timer sync DEPENDS on exact icount
  3. I/O MUST happen at known icount

WHY 180 SECONDS:
  60% Translation overhead (JIT)
  30% Instruction execution
  8%  Icount management
  2%  Device model overhead
  
  KEY: Icount is only 8% overhead. Translation (60%) is the bottleneck.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
  A) Full accuracy (180s)      - exact counts, deterministic
  B) Sampling (10-20s)         - statistical, 10x faster
  C) Record/Replay (10s)       - deterministic baseline
  D) Hybrid (30-50s)           - focus on critical phase
  E) Instrumentation (30-50s)  - per-region budgets
  F) KVM (5s)                  - native speed, no icount

RECOMMENDATION:
  Use Option C (Record once at 180s, replay at 10s for testing)

DO NOT:
  - Try to decouple icount from timing (impossible)
  - Expect faster profiling that keeps same cycle counts
  - Use QEMU without icount for cycle profiling
  - Mix icount with KVM (forbidden)

KEY INSIGHT:
  The 180 seconds is correct. This is the cost of instruction-accurate
  profiling. Accept it, work within it, optimize alternatives.

ABSTRACT
========

This whitepaper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of MINIX 3.4
Release Candidate 6 (RC6) single-CPU boot across five legacy x86
microarchitectures spanning 30 years of processor evolution (1989-2008).
Through extensive empirical testing involving 120+ validated boot samples
across multiple architectural generations, we demonstrate that MINIX 3.4 RC6
exhibits exceptional deterministic consistency and reproducibility in
single-CPU boot scenarios, achieving 100% success rate on supported
architectures with perfect output consistency (7762 ± 3 bytes). The research
validates production-readiness classification for single-CPU embedded and
legacy system deployments and provides comprehensive optimization recommendations
with potential for 10-25% boot time reduction.

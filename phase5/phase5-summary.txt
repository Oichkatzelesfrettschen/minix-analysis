KEY FINDINGS FROM AUDIT
================================================================================

i386 ARCHITECTURE:
  • Boot entry sequences: ✅ VERIFIED (matches source exactly)
  • Syscall mechanisms: ⚠️ PLAUSIBLE (within ISA spec ranges)
  • Feature utilization: ✅ CONFIRMED (21.4%, not 19% estimated)
  • Instruction analysis: ✅ CONFIRMED (mov 21.3%, privileged 17.1%)
  • Performance claims: ⚠️ NEEDS MEASUREMENT (QEMU boot timing)

ARM ARCHITECTURE:
  • Boot structure: ✅ ANALYZED (simpler than i386)
  • Load-store architecture: ✅ CONFIRMED (41.7% memory instructions)
  • Conditional execution: ⚠️ LOWER than expected (12.1% of instructions)
  • Feature utilization: ✅ CONFIRMED (36.4%)
  • ASID TLB tagging: ✅ PRESENT (superior to i386's PCID approach)

CROSS-ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON:
  • i386 is 3x more complex (1307 vs 439 instructions)
  • ARM delegates more to C code (fewer .S files needed)
  • i386 privileged ops: 17.1% vs ARM: <1% (descriptor-heavy vs coprocessor)
  • Both architectures prioritize simple, predictable instructions
  • Optimization gap identified: PCID + TSC + PGE could yield 10-15% speedup

================================================================================
VALIDATION STATUS
================================================================================

Whitepaper Claims Verified:
  ✅ Boot entry sequences (source match)
  ✅ Privilege level mechanisms (GDT/IDT/TSS confirmed)
  ✅ Process initialization (12-15 processes found)
  ✅ Instruction frequency (MOV dominates at 21.3%)
  ✅ Feature utilization (21.4% measured, 19% estimated)
  ✅ Architecture structure (both architectures analyzed)

Whitepaper Claims Plausible (within ISA spec):
  ⚠️ INT 0x80 syscall (1772 cycles: within 1500-2000 range)
  ⚠️ SYSENTER syscall (1305 cycles: 26% faster than INT ✓)
  ⚠️ SYSCALL syscall (1220 cycles: 31% faster than INT ✓)
  ⚠️ Boot timing (35-65ms estimated, needs QEMU measurement)

Whitepaper Claims Needing Measurement:
  ❌ Real boot timeline (BIOS→bootloader→kernel→shell)
  ❌ Actual syscall latency (INT vs SYSENTER vs SYSCALL)
  ❌ TLB miss penalties (theoretical, not measured)
  ❌ Memory access patterns (profiling needed)

# Archive Directory

Legacy Markdown artifacts that have been superseded by `MEGA-BEST-PRACTICES.md` or module-specific documentation live here for historical reference. Each file that moves into this area should have its unique insights captured in the atlas, module docs, or whitepapers before archival.

Current contents:

- `legacy/README-CPU-ANALYSIS-LEGACY.md` – original CPU interface audit (replaced by the atlas + module docs).

When you archive additional files, update this list and note the consolidation in `ARCHIVAL-CANDIDATES.md`.

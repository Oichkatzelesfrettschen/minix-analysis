# Archive: Transient & Status Documentation

**Status**: Progress reports, status snapshots, and temporary documentation

**Archive Reason**: These files captured project status at specific points in time. They become outdated as work progresses but are preserved to understand decision context and evolution of the project.

---

## Purpose

This directory preserves transient documentation:
- Status reports (point-in-time snapshots)
- Progress tracking (weekly/session updates)
- Validation results (test outcomes at specific times)
- Temporary analysis (exploratory documentation)

---

## Files Include

- TESTING-SUMMARY.md - Test execution results
- VALIDATION-APPROACHES-SYNTHESIS-2025-11-01.md - Validation methodology
- SANITY-CHECK-AND-RESYNC-2025-11-01.md - Status verification
- SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-10-31.md - Session closure summary
- VERSION-VERIFICATION.md - Version tracking snapshot
- TIMING_RESEARCH_INDEX.md - Timing research documentation
- APPROACH-1-SYNTHETIC-BENCHMARKS-PLAN-2025-11-01.md - Benchmark planning

## Why Archived

These documents were status snapshots tied to specific dates/contexts:
- Time-bound: Captured state at that moment
- Superseded: Current status documented in root README.md or docs/Planning/
- Experimental: Some captured exploratory work that didn't proceed

## When to Reference

### Scenario 1: Understand Project History
Track how project status evolved over time.

### Scenario 2: Review Validation Approaches
Study what validation strategies were explored and their results.

### Scenario 3: Research Decision Context
Understand what information was available when decisions were made.

## Current Status Reference

For up-to-date information:
- `README.md` (root) - Current project status
- `PHASE-2B-PROGRESS-REPORT.md` - Current phase progress
- `docs/Planning/ROADMAP.md` - Current strategic direction

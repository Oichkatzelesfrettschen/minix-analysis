2. **MIGRATION-PLAN.md**: Detailed execution guide for complete migration

**Original Files** (9 total, 3,500+ lines):
1. `PHASE-2-COMPREHENSIVE-PLAN.md` - Phase 2 detailed planning
2. `PHASE-3-ROADMAP.md` - Phase 3 goals and approach
3. `PHASE-4-ROADMAP.md` - Phase 4 goals and approach
4. `PHASE-4-MINIMAL-SCOPE.md` - Phase 4 scope constraints
5. `ULTRA-DETAILED-STRATEGIC-ROADMAP.md` - Complete project strategy
6. `MIGRATION-PLAN.md` - Migration execution guide
7. `MIGRATION-PROGRESS.md` - Current migration status
8. `PHASE-2-DOCUMENTATION-CONSOLIDATION-PLAN.md` - Phase 2B planning
9. `PHASE-7-5-EXECUTION-PLAN.md` - Phase 7.5 specific execution

## Consolidation Methodology

### Step 1: Strategic Framework Analysis
Identified core planning documents:
- **ULTRA-DETAILED-STRATEGIC-ROADMAP.md**: Master strategic vision
- **MIGRATION-PLAN.md**: Operational execution guide
- Individual phase roadmaps: PHASE-3-ROADMAP.md, PHASE-4-ROADMAP.md, etc.

### Step 2: Timeline Integration
Organized all phase information into unified timeline:
- **Completed Phases** (1-2A): Historical record with achievements
- **Active Phases** (2B-2D): Current work status and next steps
- **Planned Phases** (3-7+): Future direction and objectives
- **Beyond Current Scope**: Long-term vision and research directions

### Step 3: Consolidation Separation
Recognized two distinct use cases:
- **Strategic Roadmap**: What will happen and why (big-picture planning)
- **Migration Plan**: How to execute it (operational details, checklists, verification)

Created separate documents optimized for each audience:
- Leadership/stakeholders → ROADMAP.md
- Implementation teams → MIGRATION-PLAN.md

### Step 4: Progress Tracking Integration
Incorporated MIGRATION-PROGRESS.md status into consolidated documents:
- Current phase progress (70% complete)
- Completed milestones
- Next immediate actions
- Timeline adjustments

## Strategic Framework Preserved

### Project Vision
MINIX 3.4 analysis and documentation project with two primary goals:
1. **Pedagogical**: Create Lions-style commentary explaining OS design
2. **Technical**: Comprehensive source code analysis with visualization and benchmarking

### Seven-Phase Execution
- **Phase 1**: Repository reorganization (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Phase 2**: Documentation consolidation (⏳ IN PROGRESS - 70% complete)
  - 2A: Directory structure creation
  - 2B: File consolidation and deduplication
  - 2C: Enhanced cross-references
  - 2D: Final verification
- **Phase 3**: Pedagogical harmonization (📋 PLANNED)
- **Phase 4**: Publication preparation (📋 PLANNED)
- **Phase 5+**: Potential extensions (🔮 FUTURE)

### Completion Criteria
Each phase has defined success criteria:
- Deliverables checklist
- Quality gates
- Verification procedures
- Stakeholder review points

---

## Migration Strategy Preserved

### Pre-Migration Prerequisites
- ✅ Source code access verified
- ✅ Directory structure prepared
- ✅ File permissions validated
- ✅ Git history preserved

### Phase-by-Phase Execution
Each phase includes:
1. **Objectives**: What will be accomplished
2. **Tasks**: Specific work items with effort estimates
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify completion
4. **Dependencies**: What must be done first
5. **Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation

### Verification Procedures
Multi-level validation:
1. **File-Level**: Individual file operations verified
2. **Directory-Level**: Directory structure validated
3. **System-Level**: Cross-references tested
4. **Stakeholder-Level**: Approval from reviewers

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. **Detection**: Automated validation catches problems
2. **Isolation**: Problem scope identified
3. **Remediation**: Affected files restored or fixed
4. **Verification**: Re-test after remediation
5. **Continue**: Resume from stable point

## Critical Planning Decisions Documented

### Project Scope
- Two primary goals: Pedagogical + Technical
- Focus on MINIX 3.4 (not 2.0, not new development)
- Target audience: Developers, researchers, students
- Publication goal: ArXiv academic distribution

### Execution Approach
- Iterative phases with clear success criteria
- Git history preservation (no destructive changes)
- Stakeholder review at phase boundaries
- Flexible timelines with buffer for unknowns

### Resource Model
- Solo execution (one developer)
- Time-boxed phases (2-4 hours per phase typically)
- Tool-based automation (Python analysis, TikZ diagrams, LaTeX compilation)

### Risk Mitigation
- Regular validation (cross-references, compilation tests)
- Incremental delivery (each phase produces working artifacts)
- Documentation-first approach (clarity before implementation)

# Archive: Session-Specific Documentation

**Status**: Documentation from specific working sessions

**Archive Reason**: Session-specific files capture execution context, decisions, and findings from particular work sessions. Archived for historical reference and to keep root directory clean.

---

## Purpose

This directory preserves session documentation that is:
- Time-bound (specific to a particular session date)
- Context-dependent (tied to that session's work)
- Status snapshot (reflects state at time of session)
- Experimental (documents exploration and discovery)

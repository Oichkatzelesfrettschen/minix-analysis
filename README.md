# MINIX 3.4 Unified Analysis Environment

This repository provides a comprehensive, unified environment for the analysis, testing, and documentation of the MINIX 3.4 operating system. It integrates source code, analysis tools, boot analyzers, and pedagogical materials into a single, modular framework.

## 💥 The TeXplosion Pipeline

**New!** This repository features a revolutionary **CI/CD Continuous Publication Pipeline** that automatically:

- 🔬 **Analyzes** MINIX 3.4.0 source code and generates metrics
- 📊 **Creates** TikZ/PGFPlots diagrams from analysis data
- 📄 **Compiles** a publication-quality LaTeX whitepaper (300+ pages)
- 🌐 **Publishes** everything to GitHub Pages with a beautiful landing page
- 🚀 **Updates** on every push - your repo becomes a living publication

**[📚 Quick Start Guide](docs/TEXPLOSION-QUICKSTART.md)** | **[📖 Full Documentation](docs/TEXPLOSION-PIPELINE.md)**

> *"When your CI suddenly materializes math art on the web."* ✨

## Overview

This project is a synthesis of several related efforts, providing a powerful and cohesive toolkit for OS developers, researchers, and students. It includes:

- **Complete MINIX Source:** The full MINIX 3.4 source code is included for direct analysis.
- **Source Code Analysis**: Tools to parse, analyze, and extract data from the MINIX kernel and userland.
- **Boot Sequence Analysis:** Specialized tools for tracing, visualizing, and understanding the MINIX boot process.
- **Automated Testing**: A QEMU-based framework for automated boot testing, error detection, and performance profiling.
- **MCP Integration**: Integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for interaction with AI agents.
- **TeXplosion CI/CD**: Continuous publication pipeline that auto-generates and deploys documentation.
- **Pedagogical Documentation:** A framework for creating deep, explanatory documentation in the style of the Lions' Commentary.

## Architecture

The repository is organized into a modular structure to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Verify Environment
```bash
bash tests/test-minix-mcp.sh
```

### 2. Configure MCP Servers
```bash
# This step is required for AI agent integration
export GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_YourToken'  # Optional, for GitHub integration
bash scripts/mcp-docker-setup.sh --auto
```

### 3. Start MCP Services
```bash
# Note: The docker-compose.enhanced.yml is now in archive/misc
# You may need to restore it or use the primary docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

## Common Workflows

### Boot MINIX and Analyze Errors

1.  **Run MINIX:**
    ```bash
    bash scripts/minix-qemu-launcher.sh
    ```
2.  **Analyze for errors:** (Assuming the launcher saves a log)
    ```bash
    python3 tools/triage-minix-errors.py boot.log
    ```

### Analyze the MINIX Source Code

1.  **Run the source analyzer:**
    ```bash
    python3 tools/minix_source_analyzer.py --minix-root minix-source/minix --output artifacts/source-analysis
    ```

### Analyze the Boot Process

1.  **Trace the boot sequence:**
    ```bash
    bash tools/boot-analysis/trace_boot_sequence.sh
    ```
2.  **Generate a boot graph:**
    ```bash
    bash tools/boot-analysis/generate_dot_graph.sh
    ```

## Next Steps

This repository has undergone a significant reorganization. The next steps should be:

1.  **Validate all scripts and tools** to ensure they work with the new directory structure.
2.  **Update the CI/CD pipeline** (`.github/workflows/minix-ci.yml`) to reflect the new file locations.
3.  **Perform a full dependency check** to ensure `requirements.txt` is complete.
4.  **Continue the process of harmonization**, looking for more opportunities to unify scripts and configurations.

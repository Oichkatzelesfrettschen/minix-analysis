================================================================================

Build Status: SUCCESS (warnings only, no fatal errors)

Fatal Errors: 0
Critical Issues: 0

Non-Fatal Warnings (8 documented and expected):
  1. Empty bibliography - expected (no citations configured)
  2. Undefined references - resolved after pass 2
  3. Label changes - resolved after pass 2
  4. Font shape warnings (T1/lmtt/m/scit) - fallback to scsl (acceptable)
  5. Overfull hbox - 3 instances (text wrapping issues, non-blocking)
  6. BibTeX rerun suggestion - only needed if adding citations

All warnings are non-blocking and expected for initial build without citations.

================================================================================
CORRECTIONS APPLIED IN FINAL BUILD
================================================================================

CRITICAL FIX #1: Data Fabrication Cessation
  Issue: Ch07 originally contained false technical claims (AVX2 deferral, 
         non-existent x86_64 SYSCALL instructions in 32-bit system)
  Root Cause: Plausible-sounding but unsourced content generation
  Resolution: Complete rewrite with honest frameworks and TODO markers
  Status: RESOLVED - Ch07 now contains verifiable content structure
  Impact: High (restored credibility, aligned with actual architecture)

CRITICAL FIX #2: LaTeX Syntax Error in Ch09
  Issue: Line 119 had mismatched bracket: \textbf{IPC Verification:]
  Error Type: Unclosed group causing "enumerate ended by \end{document}"
  Resolution: Corrected to \textbf{IPC Verification:}
  Status: RESOLVED - Pass 1 now completes successfully
  Impact: Critical (prevented compilation completion)

CRITICAL FIX #3: Special Character Escaping in Ch11
  Issue: Forward slashes in file paths (kernel/arch/i386/arch_system.c)
         caused "Missing $ inserted" errors in math mode
  Error Type: LaTeX math mode parsing issue with unescaped slashes
  Resolution: Wrapped paths in \code{...} and escaped underscores
  Status: RESOLVED - Math mode errors eliminated
  Impact: Medium (blocked PDF generation)

================================================================================

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
================================================================================

Current Limitations (Non-Blocking):
  1. Bibliography empty (expected, citations not yet configured)
  2. TODO markers throughout chapters (placeholders for empirical data)
  3. Some overfull hbox warnings (text layout optimization opportunity)
  4. No fabricated data to fill (honest frameworks instead)

Recommended Future Enhancements:
  1. Add actual boot timing measurements from MINIX execution
  2. Populate results sections with empirical performance data
  3. Add citations to academic references and MINIX documentation
  4. Generate diagrams from actual source code analysis tools
  5. Add performance benchmarks and stress test results
  6. Include error injection test cases and recovery validation
